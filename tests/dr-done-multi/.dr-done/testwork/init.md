# Initialize Test Workstream

This task should be decomposed into three subtasks:

1. **Create hello.txt** - Create a file called `hello.txt` in the repository root with the content "Hello from dr-done!"

2. **Create goodbye.txt** - Create a file called `goodbye.txt` in the repository root with the content "Goodbye from dr-done!"

3. **Impossible task** - Read the file `/nonexistent/path/that/does/not/exist/impossible.txt` and copy its contents to `impossible-output.txt`. This file does not exist and cannot be created, so this task is impossible to complete.

Decompose this task into three separate subtask files (101, 102, 103) and mark this init task as done.

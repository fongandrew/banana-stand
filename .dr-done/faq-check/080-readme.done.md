The README in .faq-check should be auto-generated by some sort of set up script (maybe the first time the `/faq-check:add` command is run or a `/faq-check:setup` command?)

We should have a copy of the README in a `templates` directory in the plugin directory that the plugin can copy to the `.faq-check` directory in a repo when creating it for the first time.

## Summary

Implemented automatic README initialization for the faq-check plugin:

1. Created `plugins/faq-check/templates/` directory with a template README.md
2. Updated `/faq-check:add` command to include "Step 0: Initialize FAQ directory":
   - Checks if `.faq-check` directory exists
   - If not, creates the directory and copies the README template
   - Informs the user about the initialization before proceeding with FAQ creation

The template README contains the same comprehensive documentation as the existing `.faq-check/README.md`.

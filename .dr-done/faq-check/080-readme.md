The README in .faq-check should be auto-generated by some sort of set up script (maybe the first time the `/faq-check:add` command is run or a `/faq-check:setup` command?)

We should have a copy of the README in a `templates` directory in the plugin directory that the plugin can copy to the `.faq-check` directory in a repo when creating it for the first time.

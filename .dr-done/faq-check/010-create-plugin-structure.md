# Create Plugin Directory Structure

Create the basic directory structure for the faq-check plugin:

```
plugins/faq-check/
  hooks/
  scripts/
  commands/
```

Also create the repo-level FAQ storage directory:

```
.faq-check/
```

This is a scaffold task - just create empty directories (with .gitkeep if needed).
